# VACN

## Verifiable Autonomous Compute Network

### A Protocol Thesis for Autonomous Computation, Proof, and Machine Economies

---

# Abstract

Blockchains established decentralized consensus over transactions.
Cloud networks scaled computation.
Artificial intelligence introduced autonomous software actors.

A missing primitive remains:

How do autonomous computations become trust-minimized, verifiable, economically coordinated, and globally routable?

This paper introduces **VACN (Verifiable Autonomous Compute Network)**:

A decentralized protocol for:

* executing autonomous agent workloads
* generating proofs of autonomous execution
* verifying computation outcomes
* coordinating machine labor markets
* settling economic activity around proven work

VACN treats autonomous computation itself as a network primitive.

Not agents as apps.
Not compute as infrastructure.

But computation as a provable economic object.

# Core Primitive: Proof of Autonomous Execution (PoAE)

PoAE is VACN’s foundational primitive.

Each autonomous computation produces:

* Input Commitment
* Execution Trace Commitment
* Output Commitment
* Proof Artifact
* Settlement Attestation

Conceptually:

Transaction: "state transition happened"
**PoAE: "autonomous computation occurred honestly"**

This extends proof concepts beyond transactions.

# Protocol Architecture

## Layer 0 — Settlement Base (Solana & L2 Ledger)
Economic settlement is managed via a high-performance DB-backed Layer 2 ledger for instant micropayments, anchored by the Master Platform Authority Wallet on Solana. Supports receipts, staking logic, and future on-chain finality.

## Layer 1 — Verifiable Compute Layer (The Core)
Executor Nodes perform workloads using deterministic WASM, TEEs, or confidential compute (e.g., Arcium). They produce execution artifacts and emit proofs.

## Layer 2 — Proof Verification Layer
Verifier nodes validate PoAE claims. Models include Optimistic Verification, Verified Execution, and future ZK Verification. Verification becomes a protocol service.

## Layer 3 — Autonomous Compute Market
Users submit jobs. Executors compete to process them. This establishes compute routing, fee markets, and execution auctions.

## Layer 4 — Coordination Layer
Supports multi-agent DAGs, delegation, swarm execution, and autonomous task routing. Provable coordination, not just orchestration.

## Layer 5 — Machine Economy Layer
Economic activity forms above proven computation. Includes machine labor markets, agent hiring, machine payroll, and service liquidity.

## Layer 6 — Machine Capital Markets
Productive agent assets, machine credit, agent lending, and autonomous capital routing.

# Protocol Composition Strategy

VACN should not rebuild everything. It composes external protocols:

*   **Identity:** Metaplex, World ID
*   **Treasury:** Squads
*   **Liquidity:** LI.FI
*   **Confidential Compute:** Arcium
*   **Verification / Oracles:** Switchboard

**VACN owns the compute verification layer, coordination markets, and machine economy primitives.**
