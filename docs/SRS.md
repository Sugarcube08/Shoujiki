* Programmable agents as services
* Developer monetization layer
* Seamless UX for non-technical users

---

# 2. 🎯 SYSTEM SCOPE

* L2 Ledger settlement (Solana)
* Agent execution system
* Containerized deployment

---

## Excluded (for MVP)

* Multi-agent orchestration
* Advanced AI pipelines
* Cross-chain support
* Complex reputation systems

---

* Future: scalable infra

---

# 4. 👥 USER ROLES

---

## 4.1 Developer

* Creates agents via SDK
* Deploys agents
* Sets pricing
* Earns from usage

---

## 4.2 User (Client)

* Connects wallet
* Browses marketplace
* Verifies L2 balance
* Executes agents

---

# 5. ⚙️ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

---

# 5.1 SDK MODULE

### Features:

* Define agent class
* Standard interface (`run(input)`)
* CLI for deployment

---

### Example:

```python
class Agent:
    def run(self, input):
        return result
```

---

### CLI:

```bash
shoujiki deploy agent.py --price 0.01
```

---

### Requirements:

* Validate agent structure
* Package agent code
* Send to backend with wallet signature

---

# 5.2 AGENT REGISTRY

---

### Responsibilities:

* Store agent metadata
* Store agent code
* Maintain ownership

---

### Data Model:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "agent_name",
  "code": "...",
  "price": 0.01,
  "creator_wallet": "...",
  "created_at": "..."
}
```

---

### Requirements:

* CRUD operations
* Fetch agents
* Versioning (optional)

---

# 5.3 MARKETPLACE

---

### Features:

* List agents
* Search agents
* Display pricing
* Trigger execution

---

### UI Requirements:

* Wallet connect (Phantom)
* Agent cards
* Execution form
* Transaction confirmation

---

# 5.4 AUTHENTICATION (WALLET)

---

### Flow:

1. User signs message
2. Backend verifies signature
3. JWT issued

---

### Requirements:

* No username/password
* Wallet = identity

---

# 5.5 PAYMENT + L2 LEDGER SYSTEM

---

### Flow:

```text
User → Deposit → L2 Wallet → Execute → Settlement → Developer
```

---

### Requirements:

* Accept transaction signature for deposits
* Verify via Solana RPC
* Verify L2 balance before execution
* Atomic settlement after success


---

### MVP Simplification:

* L2 ledger tracking
* On-chain verification

---

# 5.6 AGENT EXECUTION ENGINE

---

### Responsibilities:

* Fetch agent code
* Validate payment
* Execute agent
* Return result

---

### Requirements:

* Must NOT execute in main process
* Must call sandbox

---

# 5.7 SANDBOX (CRITICAL)

---

### Responsibilities:

* Isolated execution
* Resource limits
* Safe environment

---

### Requirements:

* Docker-based execution
* No host access
* Time + memory limits

---

# 5.8 BILLING SYSTEM

---

### Responsibilities:

* Track payments
* Link to tasks
* Release funds

---

### Data Model:

```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "amount": 0.01,
  "status": "locked | released"
}
```

---

# 6. 🔄 SYSTEM FLOW

---

## 6.1 Developer Flow

```text
Write Agent → Deploy via SDK → Stored in Registry → Visible in Marketplace
```

---

## 6.2 User Flow

```text
Connect Wallet → Browse → Select Agent → Pay → Execute → Receive Result
```

---

## 6.3 Execution Flow

```text
Verify L2 Balance → Fetch Agent → Sandbox Execute → Return Output → Settle L2
```

---

# 7. 🗄️ DATABASE DESIGN

---

## Tables:

### Agents

* id
* name
* code
* price
* creator_wallet

---

### Tasks

* id
* agent_id
* input
* result
* status

---

### Payments

* amount
* status

---

# 8. 🔐 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

---

## Security
